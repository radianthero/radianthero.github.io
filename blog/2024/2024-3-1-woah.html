            <h1>I'm a terrible host</h1>

            <p>Clearly it's been busy with work a bit, and I was working on my translation project for a while. The good news is that I was able to get disc 2, which is an FMV of animation. Originally there wasn't a way to get English text with the in-game engine, but I found a way to insert my own video with subtitles spliced inside of them. Another thing I was working on was playing more Glover.</p>

            <p>The Misfit Mascot Replay is a speedrunning event where people play games for old/dead mascots. I originally wasn't going to even play, and I just signed up for commentary, but one of the rules for the event is you need 4 players to play (there are 4 different groups), and there was about a week before they closed submissions. Wanting the game to get into the event, I joined. I haven't played in about a year, so I have to practice a bunch just to get consistent again, which obviously takes time to get rid of the rust. Here's the trailer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NodLpx5NrEQ" target="_blank">watch the trailer</a>.</p>

            <p>On better news, I got a new keyboard! <a href="https://varmilo.com/products/minilo75?variant=44272593862875" target="_blank">Check it out here</a>. I'm still getting a bit used to the feeling of a smaller keyboard, but the super quiet keycaps are amazing. It doesn't require as much force to type, so sometimes I press down on a key after I finish typing, which is... cool. It also came with a Bluetooth dongle, which works for the Wii, and thus works for Phantasy Star Online!</p>

            <img src="../../pics/blog/pso.jpg" alt="Phantasy Star Online in-game keyboard working" />

            <p>The translation is 2 chapters away from finishing, along with someone with proper Japanese skills to translate disc 2 properly. I used YouTube's auto-translate, along with basic speaking skills to make it, but for now, work is slowing way down, and my translation project is on hold for now as well.</p>

            <p>The other thing I've been doing is playing Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, super amazing game and I'm definitely addicted to it, lol. I'm 58 hours in and I still haven't beaten the game yet, but I think I'm close.</p>

            <h2>So what are the plans going forward?</h2>

            <p>I have already made two sketches that need to be finished, and I have some more ideas as well, so I'm certainly not short on things to make. Outside of that, I'll want to finish the game itself. The translation will mostly be on pause until someone is able to help finish translating the last 2 chapters, though thankfully we're almost done!

            <p>On March 16, around 10:20 pm EST, I'll be playing Glover live for the relay, so I'll be practicing again for a bit.</p>

            <p>I promise the next post will be an art-related one, and won't take another month to do, lol.</p>
